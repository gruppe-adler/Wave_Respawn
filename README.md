# Wave Respawn System
Modularized version of the respawn system that was originally created for the [GA EndGame Template](https://github.com/gruppe-adler/TvT_EndGame_Template.Stratis).

Paste/merge files into your mission folder. Mission parameters in description.ext can be at any position (first parameter doesn't have to have ID 0 in paramsArray).

If you are using custom loadouts, edit initPlayerLocal.sqf to include your loadout files. - Else players will respawn with vanilla loadout.

Mission Parameters:
* Blufor wave size
* Opfor wave size
* Independent wave size
* Player respawn time
* Wave respawn time
