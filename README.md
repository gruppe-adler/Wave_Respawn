# Wave Respawn System
Modularized version of the respawn system that was originally created for the [GA EndGame Template](https://github.com/gruppe-adler/TvT_EndGame_Template.Stratis).

Paste/merge files into your mission folder.  
If you are using custom loadouts, edit initPlayerLocal.sqf to include your loadout files. - Else players will respawn with vanilla loadout.
